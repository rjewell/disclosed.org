title: 1967 in Review
---

_Catching up on publishing my notes from 1967! (part of a long series where I spend a few months listening to as much pop music as I can from one year progressing from 1965 to 1985)_ 

We're in season 3 of this adventure, listening in August, September, and October. On one hand, I'm finding myself anxious to get to the early 70's, as outside of this experiment I am starting to notice more what timeframe my most favorite music comes from. It shouldn't be a surprised - I was sorting my record collection and I don't even have a 60's section; the few items from that decade are mixed into smaller Jazz or Quaint Pop I Got For Free sections. 

On the other hand, each year that goes by drops some serious bombs on me. My breadth was narrower this iteration, because when I looked at the unpruned list, I kept wanting to listen to the same few things. I'm finding writing summaries is similarly difficult. In such a short list I still want to comment on nearly every one. I suspect the format for future years will have to change.

## Unsurprising Romps
- The Velvet Underground & Nico - The Velvet Underground & Nico: While I'm writing these, I click around in the track lists to jog my memory, but this one got a full play through. I feel a bit like this one is cheating, because I know it wasn't very popular that year, but I think that serves the point of exploring the music history even more.
- The Jimi Hendrix Experience - Are You Experienced: Holy shit. I knew this album more intimately than any other so far, but again - putting this in the timeline next to all these other psych rock acts made them seem like total phonies. (and he put out TWO great albums this year)
- The Beatles - Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band: What a sweeper. I guess this is very McCartney-heavy, so it makes sense that I like it.

## Other Sounds Absorbed
- Grateful Dead - The Grateful Dead: I understand that this is the general consensus with this album, but the band is so majestic and loved, so I was hoping to get into it and that did not happen. A few months later while writing this, I don't remember it at all.
- Jefferson Airplane - Surrealistic Pillow: This converted me. I have read that the band was disappointed with the album because it felt too crisp and over-produced and didn't capture their real sound. I wouldn't change a thing. Embryonic Journey!
- Leonard Cohen - Songs Of Leonard Cohen: Another conversion. It's not surprising that the lyricism is mature compared to a lot of the rockers of the time, what have we a poet/writer and all. It feels like a good introduction to the artist, and I'm looking forward to the rest of the catalog over the years.

**Total Albums**: 27  
**Most Played**: - The Jimi Hendrix Experience - Are You Experienced

After reading a bit about the Album Era, now I'm seeing references everywhere. When visiting the wikipedia article for MJ's [Thriller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_(album)) album, I find:

> *Thriller* was released at around the peak of the [album era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album_era), which had positioned full-length records ahead of singles as the dominant form of recorded-music consumption and artistic expression in the industry. The success of *Thriller*'s singles, however, marked a brief resurgence in the sales of the format.

There's probably another term for the circular reference trash that exists in wikipedia - define something once and people run everywhere to try and use it.

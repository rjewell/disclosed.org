_Catching up on publishing my notes from 1966!_ 

## The Music

I selected 35 albums from 1966 for listening. Again, I really tried to listen to them all intently, and I think I succeeded. This year had more albums that I knew I would like than the previous year, and a few surprises that were mostly new to me. In addition to some heavy hitters (Blonde on Blonde, Pet Sounds, Revolver!), I enjoyed these notables:

- The Hollies - For Certain Because...:  I had my headphones on and went for a meander in the woods for this one. It was a memorable walk off the path down a river bed and I'm not sure if that's because I liked the album or I liked the album so much because the walk was good. Either way, the edition I listened to was all 12 tracks in Mono and then in Stereo, and I listened straight through both. Either way, really cool composition and super solid hooks. I kept coming back to this all season. **Cool track: Pay You Back With Interest**
- Richie Havens - Mixed Bag: Another set totally unfamiliar to me that I couldn't put down. He's got such a cool sound. He voice vibrates, and the songs could be sad or bright but always just drove through, and there was a soft jazz undertone to it all. **Familiar Track: Handsome Johnny**
- The Mothers of Invention - Freak Out!: I can't picture this being from 1966. I know Zappa less than most, but I can see his imprint on a ton of music I do know. **Weenest Track: I Go Cry On Somebody Else's Shoulder**
- Donovan - Sunshine Superman: No surprise at all, I knew I liked this. One of the descriptions called it "wistful," and I appreciate that. The hits (Season of the Witch and Sunsine Superman) are fun, but I think I more enjoyed some of the weirder folk tracks. **Court of Arthurest song: Guinevere**
- The Shadows of Knight - Gloria: Foreshadowing a bit, as I'm writing this after listening to 1967 and 1968, but I have to say I'm tired of British Blues. So tired. I'm exhausted. This band comes off in that ilk at times, but when they open up a bit it's really great. **Them Cover Track: Gloria**
- Gordon Lightfoot - Lightfoot: Just go listen to The Way I Feel. **Gordon Lightfoot Track: The Way I Feel**

**Most Played**: ? and the Mysterians - 96 Tears

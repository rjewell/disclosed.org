title: All Seven and We'll Watch Them Fall
---

Ben E. King's 4th album, Seven Letters, was a surprising delight. Containing songs recorded over a two year period, it's very sonically diverse and very easy to listen through. The title track is hardcore. The album art is fantastic. There are a couple genre-hoppers that are almost caricatures, but are very fun.

"I'm Standing By" is apparently a sequel to his earlier/later hit, "Stand By Me"? Either way, front to back it's a keeper. It sadly was somewhat of a commercial failure because it didn't generate any hit singles, but that's the whole spirit of the Album Era, right?
